Clientside networking process

How a networking operation is handled from the renderer process
Implements the concepts from networking-protocol

Renderer and main are processes within electron


	    -Send-
Renderer		  Main	                   Server
   | --- requestType, --->  |  --- requestType, --->  |
   |     data,              |      data,              |
   |     dataIdentifiers    |      dataIdentifiers,   |
   |                        |      timestamp,         |
   |                        |      id                 |

1. Renderer process first emits a "networking-send" event along with its 3 parameters
   requestType, data(if applicable), dataIdentifiers

2. Main process receives the "networking-send" event and attaches a timestamp and id,
   serializing everything into JSON and sending it to the server


	    -Receive-
Server                    Main                    Renderer
  | --- requestType, --->  | --- data, ----------->  |
  |     data,              |     dataIdentifiers     |
  |     dataIdentifiers,   |                         |
  |     timestamp,         |                         |
  |     id                 |                         |

1. Server sends back reply packet in JSON

2. Main process deserializes received packet, utilises the id to determine which
   renderer process to send the received data and dataIdentifiers to via a reply to the
   "networking-send" event, initiated by the send process
