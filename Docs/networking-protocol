It consists of 4 RequestTypes
    - Get              Client obtaining data from the server
    - Post             Client uploading data to the server
    - Update           Server updating data to client(s)
    - Response         Used to mark a response from the server from the RequestType Get



Exchange protocol

The standard exchange of information between a new client and server is the following:

	    Client startup
   Server                            Client 1
     |  <------------ Get ------------  |      Client requests data stored on the server to present to the user
     |                                  |
     |                                  |
     |  ---------- Response --------->  |      Server replies with the data requested
     |                                  |
	    
	    Client user modifies data
     |                                  |
     |  <----------- Post ------------  |      Client posts the modified data to the server
     |                                  |
     |                                  |        
     |                                  |           Other Clients
     |  ------------ Update --------------------------->  |	    Server updates the data on the other connected
     |                                  |                 |         clients with the new modified data



Packet information

All information exchanged utilises the following:
    JSON (JAvascript Object Notion)

Packet {
    RequestType requestType;	//One of the 4 RequestType detailed above
    String[] data;	        //Array of data to be transfered
    String[] dataIdentifiers;   //Array of identifiers for the data, index of dataIdentifier correlates to the index of the data
    long timestamp;             //Unix timestamp of when the packet was sent
    long id;                    //Used to identify sent and received packets by the client
}
